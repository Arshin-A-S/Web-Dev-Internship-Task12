# Task 12: Interactive Image Gallery with Modal
In this task, I developed a responsive image gallery featuring a custom-built Lightbox modal. This project focuses on high-level DOM interaction, CSS animations, and improving User Experience (UX) through focus management.

## Key Features
* CSS Grid Gallery: Created a fluid, auto-fitting thumbnail grid that adapts to any screen size without media queries.

* Dynamic Modal Engine: Built a single modal component that dynamically updates its content (source image and caption) based on the user's selection.

* Enhanced UX & Focus:

  * Background Overlay: I have used semi-transparent backdrops to isolate the modal content.
  * Scroll Locking: Implemented JavaScript logic to disable background scrolling while the modal is active.

* Accessibility & Interaction:

  * Keyboard Control: I have integrated an "Escape" key listener for quick closing.
  * Click-to-Close: I have enabled closing the modal by clicking the background overlay.
  * Smooth Transitions: I have added CSS @keyframes to create a "zoom" entry effect for the enlarged images.
